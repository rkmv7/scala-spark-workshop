# Scala Spark Workshop
This repository collects the Databricks notebooks used in the Scala Spark workshop held at universities by Tenaris Data Science Department.

## Contents
The repository contains two Databricks notebooks made for Databricks Community Edition. The aim is to teach Spark fundamentals to future Software Engineers.

One notebooks contains excercises to be completed by students, while the other contains the solutions. 

Notebooks are in Italian and can run on Spark 2.0+ clusters. The previous edition of classes was based on Spark 1.6+: the code is still available under the branch spark_1.6.0.
